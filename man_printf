.TH _PRINTF 3 "17 March 2017" "0.1" "Holberton Students _printf Manuel"
.SH NAME
.B _printf
- our version of printf.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B	#include "holberton.h"

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
	The function _printf() writes output to standard output. It writes the\
 output under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent\
 arguments are converted for output.
.SS Return Value
	Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters\
 printed, which exclude the terminating null byte ('\0').
.SH THE FLAG CHARACTERS

.B  The flag characters are currently in development phase.

.SH THE LENGTH MODIFIERS

.B  The length modifiers are currently in development phase.

.SH THE CONVERSION SPECIFIERS

.SS c
	The int argument converts to an unsigned char, and the resulting charac\
ter is written.
.P
.SS s
	The argument shall be a literal string. No special provisions are made\
 for multibyte characters.The behavior of printf with the s conversion\
 specifier is undefined if the argument value is not a pointer to a literal\
 string. Characters from the literal string array are written up to, but not\
 including, the terminating null byte ('\0').
.P
.SS %
	A % character is written and no argument is converted. The complete con\
version specification is '%%'.
.P
.SS b
	The unsigned int argument is converted to binary.
.P
.SS d, i
	The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.P
.SS p
	The pointer is printed in hexidecimal format preceded by '0x'.
.P
.SS r, R
	'r' prints string in reverse. 'R' prints encrypted rot13.
.P
.SS o, u, x, X
	The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned\
 decimal (u), or unsigned hexidecimal notation (x or X); the letters abcdef are\
 used for x conversion and the letters ABCDEF for X conversion.
.P
.SS S
	Prints ascii characters #32 - #127 as they appear in the argument\
 string. All other ascii characters are converted to hexidecimal, then written
 to standard output.

.SH BUGS
Unknown bugs exist for unknown cases of either 'c', 's', or % specifiers\
Additionally, 'p' specifier has unknown bugs.  The 'r' and 'R' specifiers also\
have unknown bugs.  Precision and flags have not been accounted for.\
