.B _printf
- our version of printf.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdarg.h>

	int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
	The functions in _printf produce output according to a format as described. The function _printf()
	write output to stdout. It writes the output under the control of a format string that specifies how
	subsequent arguments are converted for output.
.SS Return Value
	Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed, which exclude the
	null byte ('\0').
.SH THE FLAG CHARACTERS
.SS 0
	Pads the number with zeroes instead of spaces, where padding is clearly defined.
.P
.SS +
	A sign (+ or -) should always precede a number produced by a signed conversion. By default a 
	sign is used only for negative numbers. By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a 
	sign.
.P
.SS #
	Used with o,x or X specifiers, the value is preceded with 0, 0x, or 0X respectively for values 
	differnt than zero. for a, A, e, E, f, F, g, and G conversions, the result will always contain a 
	decimal point, even if no digits follow it. For g and G conversions, trailing zeros are not 
	removed from the result as they would otherwise be. The result is undefined for other conversions.
.P
